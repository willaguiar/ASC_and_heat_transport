# ASC_and_heat_transport

A collaborative project to investigate the relationship between ASC variability (spatial and temporal) and cross-slope heat transport variability. This will initially use ACCESS-OM2-01 IAF output, potentially evolving to use output from the panan-01, panan-005, and panan-0025 simulations currently underway.

This is a central repository where we can work on analysis scripts together, suggest new analysis directions, discuss figures etc.

## How it works
All aspects of the project are tracked through issues. Create an issue to represent each small task or analysis idea. Issues will develop to include discussion of analysis methods and figures associated with each task.

To start contributing to the code, make your own branch directly in this repository, edit away on your branch, and then submit pull requests between your branch and the master branch (or merge directly if noone else is working on the same code).

# The story so far

## Motivation for this study

[Many studies assume](https://github.com/willaguiar/ASC_and_heat_transport/issues/3) (or have found at particular regions / times) that there is a relationship between the ASC strength and the cross slope heat transport. But this assumption hasn't been tested comprehensively (across all time and space scales). That's our plan for this study.

## Results

1. We find only weak correlations between the depth average ASC and cross slope heat transport (both integrated across different regimes):

(Note there are a couple of exceptions at depth where the correlations are not so weak - 300-800m depth for the seasonality in the surface regime, and perhaps 700-900m depth for the reverse regime. Maybe check significance for these?)
Is there some way we can communicate this message more simply than the above figure? e.g. Maybe lead people in slowly with a scatter plots for a few sample regions showing weak correlation before diving into this much detail?

2. There are reasonable correlations between the ASC and cross slope heat transport at the same depth.

The correlations are particularly high for the seasonality (r $\ge$ 0.8, lower row), and are around r=0.5-0.6 at depth for the interannual correlations (middle row). The regressions are in the right direction at depth for the surface and deep regimes - a weaker (less westward) ASC results in a southward heat transport anomaly. The reverse regime relationship seems to be in the wrong direction? In the reverse regime the ASC is eastward (positive), so a negative regression means that a stronger eastward ASC is linked to stronger southward transport. How does that work?

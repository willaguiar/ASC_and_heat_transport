# The story so far

## Motivation for this study

[Many studies assume](https://github.com/willaguiar/ASC_and_heat_transport/issues/3) (or have found at particular regions / times) that there is a relationship between the ASC strength and the cross slope heat transport. But this assumption hasn't been tested comprehensively (across all time and space scales). That's our plan for this study.

## Results

1. We find only weak correlations between the depth average ASC and cross slope heat transport (both integrated across different regimes):

Is there some way we can communicate this message more simply than the above figure? e.g.

# Draft figure list

Note that there is detailed discussion of these figures in [this issue](https://github.com/willaguiar/ASC_and_heat_transport/issues/26). Let's keep the discussion on that issue, and we can use this page as a summary of that discussion.

The analysis is based on
- 10 deg bins
- CDW definition based on age tracer

Main findings:
- ASC is less correlated with poleward heat transport than assumed
- The correlation varies depending on the time scale and location

### NOTE: Each figure should have its own notebook.

## Figure 1 (Fabio)

## Figure 3-4 (tbd)

Figure 4/5 for different sub-regions (Totten, Getz) showing the time series of CSHT and ASC at key locations + composite plots at a location of high and low correlation.

## Supplementary figures (tbd)

- additional figures for method section required?

# Draft figure list

Note that there is detailed discussion of these figure in [this issue](https://github.com/willaguiar/ASC_and_heat_transport/issues/26). Let's keep the discussion on that issue, and we can use this page as a summary of that discussion.

### NOTE: Each figure should have its own notebook.

## Figure 1

Figure 1 shows how/where the regimes are defined, and what the ASC and heat transport look like on average in each regime.

a) Regime map. Something like this?

b-c) Average cross slope heat transport and ASC at each depth in each of the regimes.

## Figure 2

Figure 2 shows that there are only weak correlations between the depth average ASC and the cross slope heat transport at each depth, with the exception of heat transport at 600-800m depth in the Surface regime.

Maybe we want to remove the regression lines from this plot to keep it simpler? Also, if we include daily data, maybe we want to replace this with the correlations using daily data?

# Draft figure list

Note that there is detailed discussion of these figures in [this issue](https://github.com/willaguiar/ASC_and_heat_transport/issues/26). Let's keep the discussion on that issue, and we can use this page as a summary of that discussion.

The analysis is based on
- 10 deg bins
- CDW definition based on age tracer

Main findings:
- ASC is less correlated with poleward heat transport than assumed
- The correlation varies depending on the time scale and location
- Correlations are high in regions of large onshore heat transport

Aim for 4 Figures (GRL style manuscript)

### NOTE: Each figure should have its own notebook.

## Figure 1 (Fabio)

## Figure 2 (Ellie)

alternative version without regimes in figs directory
*uses taimoors gmm clustering regimes as placeholder - should change to wilma's

## Figure 3-4 (tbd)

Figure 3/4 for different 3 sub-regions (Totten, Getz, Amundsen) showing the time series of CSHT and ASC at key locations + composite plots at a location of high and low correlation.

## Figure 4

Schematic? Not necessary as we don't explain a new process? Could use space to extend Figure 3.

## Supplementary figures (tbd)

- Same as Fig 2 but for AASW

- 
- Same as Fig 3 but for a region of low correlation
- additional figures for method section required?

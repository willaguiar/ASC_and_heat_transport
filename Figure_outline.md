# Draft figure list

Note that there is detailed discussion of these figures in [this issue](https://github.com/willaguiar/ASC_and_heat_transport/issues/26). Let's keep the discussion on that issue, and we can use this page as a summary of that discussion.

The analysis is based on
- 10 deg bins
- CDW definition based on age tracer

Main findings:
- ASC is less correlated with poleward heat transport than assumed
- The correlation varies depending on the time scale and location

### NOTE: Each figure should have its own notebook.

## Figure 1 (Fabio)

## Figure 2 (Wilton)

Figure 2 shows the definition of CDW and that the resulting CSHT is physically plausible.

a) density curtain with contours for upper and lower CDW limits (time mean).

b) CSHT in the CDW and surface layer as cumulative sum.

## Figure 3 (Ellie)

Figure 3 shows how correlations between ASC and CSHT in the CDW layer vary with different time averaging (interannual variability, seasonal climatology and high frequency (daily minus seasonal climatology)). This figure has 6 panels where the rows are the different temporal resolutions and the columns show the correlation and the slope.
* Daily transport TBD post interpolation of mask
* [x] The values are plotted on a map (as in Fig 1) with the ASC regime definition as a bar chart for orientation at the top (maybe just the top panels?).
    * put in fig 1 to avoid clutter
* [x] Repeat the same figure for the correlations of the surface layer.
NB white bar in slope is defined to be 10\% of full range.

## Figure 4-5 (tbd)

Figure 4/5 for different sub-regions (Totten, Getz) showing the time series of CSHT and ASC at key locations + composite plots at a location of high and low correlation.

## Supplementary figures (tbd)

- additional figures for method section required?

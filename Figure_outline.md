# Draft figure list

Note that there is detailed discussion of these figures in [this issue](https://github.com/willaguiar/ASC_and_heat_transport/issues/26). Let's keep the discussion on that issue, and we can use this page as a summary of that discussion.

### NOTE: Each figure should have its own notebook.

## Figure 1 (Paul)

Figure 1 shows where the regimes are, and what the ASC and heat transport look like on average in each regime.

a) Regime map. (Note this is from Wilma's paper - need to replace this with GMM regimes.)

b-c) Average cross slope heat transport and ASC at each depth in each of the regimes.

## Figure 2

Figure 2 shows that there are only weak correlations between the depth average ASC and the cross slope heat transport at each depth, with the exception of heat transport at 600-800m depth in the Surface regime.

Maybe we want to remove the regression lines from this plot to keep it simpler? Also, if we include daily data, maybe we want to replace this with the correlations using daily data?

## Figure 3

Figure 3 shows that the correlations are higher when considering the ASC at each depth, rather than the depth-avg ASC as in the previous figure. Also here we show how the correlations vary with different time averaging (seasonal climatology and interannual variability).

We also want to add some panels showing scatterplots for only the depths where correlations > 0.5. This will help the reader understand what direction the ASC and CSHT are, e.g.

Maybe we want to include subseasonal correlations here also, using daily data? If we do that, maybe we could move the top row here up to join Figure 2 (so then Figure 2 would show depth avg vs not depth avg, and Figure 3 would just focus on correlations at different time frequencies).

## Figure 4

Figure 4 possibilities:

A) Repeat the above plot for a single basin in each regime, e.g. Totten for Surface, Ross for Deep, Wilkins for Reverse regime.

B) Schematic highlighting how the ASC and heat transport directions/magnitude are changing in each regime, just for the depths/regimes where r^2>0.5. e.g.:

<img width="400" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-18 at 10 51 45 am" src="https://github.com/willaguiar/ASC_and_heat_transport/assets/8506963/c2d6fa76-4c32-4c0c-9be4-b399d81290fe">

Possibly we want both these figures, so 5 total?

## Supplementary figures

- If we use time-varying regimes, show how they vary in time.

- Correlations/regressions in each regime with eddy/mean decomposition.

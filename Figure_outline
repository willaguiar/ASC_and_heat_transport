# Draft figure list

Note that there is detailed discussion of these figure in this issue. Let's keep the discussion on that issue, and we can use this page as a summary of that discussion.

## Motivation for this study

[Many studies assume](https://github.com/willaguiar/ASC_and_heat_transport/issues/3) (or have found at particular regions / times) that there is a relationship between the ASC strength and the cross slope heat transport. But this assumption hasn't been tested comprehensively (across all time and space scales). That's our plan for this study.
